# Challenge: 
# 
# 1. Create a custom function called "get_area" that calculates 
# the area of any right triangle. 
# 
# 2. Create a custom function called "get_perimeter" that calculates 
# the perimeter of any right triangle. 
# 
# 3. Create a custom function called "get_hypotenuse" that calculates 
# the hypotenuse of any right triangle. 
#
# When you're done, invoke all three functions using the 
# following triangle dimensions:
#    triangle 1: side_a = 5, side_b = 12
#    triangle 2: side_a = 3, side_b = 5
#    triangle 3: side_a = 4, side_b = 4
#
# BONUS: Can you figure out a way to use get_hypotenuse function within
# the get_perimeter function you already made?
