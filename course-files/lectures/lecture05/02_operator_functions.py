# Challenge:
# Using the functions above (no operators), write a program to 
# calculate the hypotenuse of several right triangles with the
# following dimensions, and prints the results to the screen:
#    triangle 1: side_a = 5, side_b = 12
#    triangle 2: side_a = 3, side_b = 5
#    triangle 3: side_a = 4, side_b = 4
