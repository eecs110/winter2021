# Your task:
# 1. Send an email to a friend
# 2. Send an email that has an (appropriate) image
#    to a friend. Example:

# CAVEAT: 
#    I have a dashboard that allows me to see every email that's
#    getting sent. These are not anonymous. Sarah can see all of the messages.
#    Just wanting to make sure that you know this.
