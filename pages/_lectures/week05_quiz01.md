* Please also do the two <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/130514/quizzes" target="_blank">practice quizzes</a>, which require using the [Lockdown Browser](../resources/lockdown-browser). To do this, download the Lockdown Browser, open it, and use it to log into Canvas. Once you've done this, navigate to the CS110 Quiz section and take the quiz just as you have taken the others.

## How to Take The Actual Quiz
There will be two windows for the quiz:

1. **Option 1:** Tuesday night from 9PM-9:50PM (intended to accommodate Asian time zones)
2. **Option 2:** Wednesday morning during regularly scheduled class time (10:00AM-10:50AM)

Anyone is welcome to take the quiz either on Tuesday evening or on Wednesday morning, regardless of where you live in the world.
