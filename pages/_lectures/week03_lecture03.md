The next two lessons will be dedicated to functions. In this lesson, we will introduce functions, including some basic terminology and why they are useful. We'll also take a look at some examples of how to use built-in functions. In the next lesson (Lesson 6), we will practice building our own functions and modules. <br><br>This week's tutorial ([Tutorial 2](../assignments/tutorial02)) and homework ([Homework 2](../assignments/hw2)) will be based on content reviewed in this lesson and the next one. You are strongly encouraged to review the content in these lessons *before* trying the lab/homework.
