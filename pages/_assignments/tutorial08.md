In today's tutorial, you're going to calculate some statistics for the Boston Marathon. To do this, you will open some of the files in the `boston_marathon` directory, loop through each line in the file, and perform some basic summary statistics. 

Please write a program to calculate the following statistics. You can write each program as a separate file, or do all of the calculations in a single file. Up to you.

## Please answer the following questions

1. How many people completed the Boston Marathon in 2015?

2. What was the average **age** of someone completing the Boston Marathon in 2015?
    * Hint: you may need to use try/except for any messy / unexpected data.

3. What was the average **time** of people who completed the Boston Marathon in 2015?
    * Hint: you will have to parse the total time into a number that can be summed. So, you may want to convert all of the times to seconds.

4. What was the average **time** for **Kenyan** runners who completed the Boston Marathon in 2015? 

5. ***[If Time]*** What was the average time for female runners in their 30s in 2015?
