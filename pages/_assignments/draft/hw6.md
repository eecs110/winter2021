In this assignment, you will be completing 20 points of your [Project 2](p2), to get a solid start before the Thanksgiving Break. Your grade will be calculated by dividing your total score (20 possible points) by 2.5 (so that it scales to 8 possible points).

## Option 1: Yelp
Please complete Parts 1-3 of Project 2, which involves asking the user for their (1) restaurant category and (2) sort preferences, and then (3) displaying any matching restaurants to the screen (with an optional keyword filter).
