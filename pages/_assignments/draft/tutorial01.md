**Reminder:** Everyone must sign up for a tutorial slot <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twZ2NDfyu0jVgvb4SMS2Cd9KEwwcPN0BZvLg0XMJuh8/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>. 

In tutorial today, you will meet your peer mentor and fellow classmates, install Python3 (if you haven't already), and write a few simple programs. Attendance at your first tutorial session is **MANDATORY**.

## Part 1: Install Python (HW1, Part1)
Please refer to part 1 of the [hw1](hw1) for instructions on how to install Python on your computer. Feel free to go through this process *before* your tutorial, but if you get stuck, tutorial is your time to get questions answered.

## Part 2: Get Your Files Organized
Create the folder organizational structure recommended in Video 1, [Lecture 3](../lectures/week02-lecture01). 

```
cs110
    |-- homework
    │   |-- hw01
    │   |-- hw02
    |   ...
    |-- lectures
    │   -- lecture01
    │   -- lecture02
    │   ...
    |-- tutorials
        |-- tutorial01
        |-- tutorial02
        ...
```

## Part 3: Create `main.py` and Write Some Programs
When you're done, open IDLE and create a new python file (go to File menu > "New File"). This should open a blank document. Then save this blank document as **`main.py`** (File menu > "Save as..."), and put it inside of your cs110 > tutorials > tutorial01 folder. 

You will edit this newly created `main.py` file in order to complete the following:

1. Write a program that accepts an integer (n), computes the value of n+nn+nnn, and prints that value result to the screen.
2. Write a program that creates some ascii art! To do this, pick and animal to draw from [this website](https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/) and implement it using the print statement.

> ### Some Pro Tips
> * Always save your python file before running it so that the interpreter "sees" your changes.
> * In order for your interpreter to recognize your file as a Python file, you must give it the **`.py`** file extension (e.g. **`my_program.py`**).
> * Don't forget to name all of your programs "snake case" (all lower case, underscores to separate words).
> * If your code doesn't run, practice reading and trying to understand (often by Googling) what the interpreter is telling you.

## Part 4: Submit
When you're done, please upload your main.py file to Canvas (under Tutorial 1).
